Selection Sort =>
                 - NOT STABLE

Bubble Sort => 
                - STABLE
                
Insertion sort => 
            - STABLE (when we are not swapping same values)                

MergeSort => 
            - T(N) = O(N log N) => for best, average and worst case
            - NOT in place (note -> call stack space also being used)
            - It is STABLE


Quick Sort => 
            - T(N) = O(N log N) => for best and average case
              T(N) = O(n^2) => for worst case  (which is very unlikely though)
            - IN Place  (note -> call stack space also being used)
            - faster in emprical analysis

Note: Java used QuickSort for primitive types and MergeSort (TimSort) for Objects.
